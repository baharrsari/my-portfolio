🌐 Live Demo

🔗 Vercel:
https://bahar-s-portfolio.vercel.app/

🔗 Netlify:
https://baharsportfolio.netlify.app/

> 📝 **Note on Deployment Platforms**  
> During testing, the Vercel deployment occasionally experienced access issues on certain mobile networks (e.g. cellular data), while remaining accessible over Wi-Fi.  
> This can be related to infrastructure-level factors such as CDN routing, ISP-level filtering, or DNS resolution differences between mobile carriers and fixed networks.  
>  
> To ensure consistent accessibility, the project is also deployed on Netlify.  
> If the Vercel link is not reachable in your network environment, the Netlify version can be used as a reliable alternative.
